Hello darling wish you a very happy birthday🤗 stay happy always and stay cute always as u are now and I don't know wat spl to do in this times of situation to surprise you in a virtual type so i found something new which will be a quite new type of surprise, hope so.In starting stage I thought of creating a bday video but every year I used to do the same.. 😁 so this time tried a new way ok let's get into the business turn on the smile in your face always because that completes your face fully.. 😇 I can't believe you are 18 years now 😂 we are growing day by day and we are adults now 😂😂 first first saw u in route number 24 😂 and I still have the memories with me and I still remember our small fights in route number 24 and our lil conversations 😂💖 and I wanna say you one thing which I never told you.. U r Bravest girl I have seen stay the same.... Stay confident in every thing... Dont matter what happened muruga gave us life only one life we should not waste it so we should enjoy each and every moment ok let me stop this the conversation is going like a advice 😂 I just want to motivate you and feel the real inside meanings of the words I said 🤗 and it's been 1 year 5 months we starting loving each other had many online memories.. Still more to go and we have just overcomed our first phrase of life and still 4 phrases to go.. The most happiest phrases are 1 2 where we can enjoy more.. So don't waste the time rather than being happy and enjoying each and every second like me 😂.. Mainly this 18 th birthday I want you to understand the life we have been gifted by the God and I want to motivate you more... Equally and show my love ❤ I don't need u say abt my love towards you coz you know abt that very much hope so.. And next year namba meet panrom for sure aprm gundu 😂 finally once again happy birthday my queen 👑👸 3 rd std la unna paakum bodhey oru feel but apo irukura society knowledge and maturity ku adhu ena nu theriyadhu aana adhu apo love hum ila oru vidhamana ne en lyf la oru mukkiyamana role play pannuva nu oru feeling and finally after 9 years this November 9 th it proved 😂 epdi.. 😂
